# **About Me**

Hi there! I'm **{{ site.author.name }}**.<br>

I'm a lover of spicy food, electronic music, and music visualizers in that order. Though, you’ll probably know me better as a gameplay engineer at ProbablyMonsters!

I earned a Master’s Degree in Game Engineering from the University of Utah in 2019, where I also worked at Warner Bros. Games Avalanche on Hogwarts Legacy. From there, I moved to the beautiful Pacific Northwest to work on Halo Infinite at 343 Industries. Before my transition into the AAA Industry, I focused on exploring diverse applications of virtual reality at my indie studio Grace Foundry. These ranged from a music visualization mobile app, a 360-degree music video generator, and a serious game for children requiring anesthesia.

My favorite video game series is Monster Hunter due to the collaborative nature of its gameplay. The communication and teamwork required to hunt a monster in a timely manner has helped me become a better teammate in real life, as I constantly aspire to learn more in order to help others. Lastly, my favorite video game of all time is Ōkami because of its masterful merging of narrative, art, adventure, and combat. The game’s captivating and beautiful world led me to study how video games are brought to life with code!
