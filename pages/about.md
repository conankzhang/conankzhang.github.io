# **About Me**

Hi there! I'm **{{ site.author.name }}**.<br>

I'm a lover of spicy food, electronic music, and music visualizers in that order. Though, you’ll probably know me better as a gameplay engineer!

My favorite video game series is Monster Hunter due to the collaborative nature of its gameplay. The communication and teamwork required to hunt a monster in a timely manner has helped me become a better teammate in real life, as I constantly aspire to learn more in order to help others. 

My favorite video game of all time is Ōkami because of its masterful merging of narrative, art, adventure, and combat. The game’s captivating and beautiful world led me to study how video games are brought to life with code!
